Overview:
Begins with clients connecting to server, at which point they are assigned an ID.
When all clients are connected the game starts, with each player submitting a data query to draw initial data.
All card selection is handled within the client (eg. card hovering).
When play/pass/takeback button is pressed, corresponding data is sent to server through make-move event.
On each make-move, the server broadcasts the new game data to each client to update hands.
