# Tractorbus Online
An online multiplayer client for playing the card game [Tractor](https://www.pagat.com/kt5/tractor.html). Visit http://tractor39.herokuapp.com/ to try it out yourself! (It might take a few seconds to load).
## Game Logic
Backend code was written in collaboration with Andrew Zhang, Adam Zheng, and Raymond Li. A version of the game built with Pygame can be found at https://github.com/adamczheng/tractor-client. All game logic was written using Python.
## GUI
Frontend code was done with Javascript and basic CSS. The user interface was inspired by Henry Charlesworth's Big 2 client(https://github.com/henrycharlesworth/big2_PPOalgorithm). Flask-SocketIO was used for networking to handle user inputs and synchronize multiplayer gameplay.
